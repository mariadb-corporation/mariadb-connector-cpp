Basic Use
---------

Connector implements JDBC API with minimal extensions and minimal
reductions of methods, that do not make sense in C++

To be able to use API, a program should include its definition in ConnCpp.h
header

#include  <mariadb/conncpp.hpp>

To obtain driver instance:
sql::Driver* driver= sql::mariadb::get_driver_instance();

To connect
sql::SQLString url("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/db");
sql::Properties properties({{"user", "root"}, {"password", "someSecretWord"}});
std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn(driver->connect(url, properties));

Alternatively, connection object can be obtained via DriverManager class. In this case Driver object is not needed,
and the connector throws exception, if connection could not be established for whatever reason. Please note, that
for conencting via DriverManager only "jdbc:mariadb://" type of URL can be used.

sql::SQLString url("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/db");
sql::Properties properties({{"user", "roor"}, {"password", "someSecretWord"}});
std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn(DriverManager::getConnection(url, properties));
// or
sql::SQLString url2("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/db?user=root&password=someSecretWord");
std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn2(DriverManager::getConnection(url));
// or
std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn3(DriverManager::getConnection(url, "root", "someSecretWord"));

            INSERT INTO ab (i) VALUES (1), (2).
            If query cannot be rewriten in "multi-values", rewrite will use
            multi-queries : INSERT INTO TABLE(col1) VALUES (?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col2=? with values [1,2] and [2,3]
            will be rewritten as
            INSERT INTO TABLE(col1) VALUES (1) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col2=2;INSERT
            INTO TABLE(col1) VALUES (3) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col2=4
            If active, the useServerPrepStmts option is set to false. Default false   bool
useBulkStmts             Use dedicated COM_STMT_BULK_EXECUTE protocol for
            executeBatch if possible. Can be significanlty faster.
            (works only with server MariaDB >= 10.2.7). Default false                 bool


Properties is map of strings, and is another way to pass optional parameters.

In addition to Connector/J URL style and JDBC connect method, Connector/C++ supports
following connect methods:

sql::SQLString user("root");
sql::SQLString pwd("root");
std::unique_ptr<sql::Connection> conn(driver->connect("tcp://localhost:3306/test", user, pwd));

and

sql::Properties properties;
properties["hostName"]= "127.0.0.1";
properties["userName"]= "root";
properties["password"]= "root";
std::unique_ptr<sql::Connection> conn(driver->connect(properties));

Host in former case can be defined as  (tcp|unix|pipe)://\<host\>[:port][/<db>]
Properties in the latter case are the same, as in the first variant of the connect
method, plus additionally supported
  - hostName
  - pipe
  - socket
  - schema
  - userName(alias for user)
  - password

std::string variables can be passed, where parameters are expected to be sql::SQLString

For further use one may refer to JDBC specs.

Except Driver object, normally this is application's responsibility to delete
objects returned by the connector.
